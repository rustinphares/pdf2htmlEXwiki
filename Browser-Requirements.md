A few features are required for a browser to show HTML files generated by pdf2htmlEX correctly
 - HTML5: A basic support is enough, especially the DOCTYPE.
  - Advanced features like `<canvas>`, `<video>` etc are NOT required.
 - CSS: Essential functional part.
  - @font-face, supports TrueType at least
  - data URI
  - transformation
  - absolute positioning
 - Javascript: only required by the default UI, which is optional
  - see also the requirements of jQuery. The default UI relies on a few functions of jQuery.

A recent version of Firefox or Chrome, or IE(>=9) should work.
