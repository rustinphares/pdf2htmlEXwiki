A few features are required for a browser to show HTML files generated by pdf2htmlEX correctly
 - HTML5: A basic support is enough, especially the DOCTYPE.
  - Advanced features like `<canvas>`, `<video>` etc are NOT required.
 - CSS: Essential functional part.
  - @font-face, supports TrueType at least
  - data URI
  - transformation
  - absolute positioning
 - Javascript: only required by the default UI, which is optional
  - see also the requirements of jQuery. The default UI relies on a few functions of jQuery.

A recent version of Firefox or Chrome, or IE(>=9) should work.

###Notes
 - [MacType](http://code.google.com/p/mactype/) might help if you are using Chrome on Windows.
 - Turn on ClearType if you are using Windows XP: (Control Panel -> Display -> Appearance -> Effects -> "Use the following method to smooth edges of screen fonts" -> ClearType)
