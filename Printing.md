The HTML pages created by pdf2htmlEX cannot be printed correctly.

- Firefox & Chrome does not respect the font family specified by @font-face.
- It's not possible (or is it?) to control the paging for printing, with HTML/CSS/Javascript

Possible solution
 - SVG? (No: Multiple page support was part of the abandoned [SVG 1.2 Full](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-SVG12-20041027/multipage.html) spec)
