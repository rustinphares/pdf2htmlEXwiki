## Report an Issue at GitHub

The [Issues](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/issues) page is the best way to report an issue, ask a question or submit a patch (via Pull Request). It is convenient for both developers and users because:
 
- Issues can be well managed.
- People can discuss together.
- Issues may be cross referenced in the discussions.
- Everything is in public and well archived, people may browse previous issues.

Here are a few tips for a perfect a bug report:

- Always read the [wiki](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki), and the manpage (run `man pdf2htmlEX`) before reporting
  - As a bonus, you can mention that you could not find anything useful in those places, such that I can make a update if necessary
- Search for existing issues to make sure that the issue has not been reported.
- Always report the version of your pdf2htmlEX (run `pdf2htmlEx -v`) and the version of your browser and OS
- Provide the problematic PDF file if possible, post the link to the location of the file.

Issues are managed by tagging, opening and closing them. Common tags include:
 - `future`: this feature/bug is not crucial right now, it will be fixed in the future eventually.
 - `need solution`: this feature/bug is important, but no solution has been found so far.
 - `patch welcome`: anyone is welcome to submit a patch for this feature/bug.

When no further action is considered to be necessary, an Issue will be closed. But this does not mean that you should open a new one if you have further questions. Please stick with the same issue, leave comments there, and reopen it if necessary.

## Mailing List

Mailing list is set up for discussion and announcements. It is not the best place to report issues. You are welcome to ask questions there. But if you try to report an issue or submit a patch, most likely you will be asked to submit an Issue/Pull Request at GitHub.

## Contacting the author

Generally this is the worst place to report issues, it achieves nothing as mentioned above which are achieved by the Issues page. Usually you are supposed to contact the author for general questions which does not fit into the Issues page or the mailing list.

However you may report a bug through email when you have to, for example when the problematic PDF file contains private information. But please expect a longer delay in this wayï¼Œsince the messages are usually archived and checked on a regular basis. You may consider making a donation to attract the author's attention in case it is emergency.
